# General
-  **I'm unable to attend lectures in person. Can I take the class asynchronously?**
    - Lecture attendance is required. Non-DCE students should only register if they can attend in person.
-  **Does the individual HW mean I have to submit on my own but can I still work with a HW partner?**
    - An *individual* CS109B HW means you are supposed to work on your own, without any human intervention, assistance, or input. You are not allowed to work with a partner. You are allowed to use OHs to ask clarification questions, but we may not be able to answer all of your questions or help with your coding. You are allowed to use all of your materials from the course up to the HW, look at problem resolution online, and look at documentation.
- **Where should I send my questions?**
    - Use Ed for anying related to the course content or assignments. All other concerns should be sent to the course helpline: cs109b2022@gmail.com

# Auditing

- **Can I audit this course? What are the rules for auditing?**
  - Yes, CS109B does accept auditors, but all auditors must agree to abide by the following rules:
    - Auditors must attend class in person. This is a Harvard policy. Auditors who do not confirm their presence with the head TF during the first week of in-class instruction will lose course access.
  	- Auditors are held to the same standard of academic honesty as our registered students. Please do not share homeworks or solutions with anyone. Violations will be reported to the Harvard Administrative Board.
  	- Auditors are not permitted to take the course for credit in the future.
  	- Audiors should **not** submit HWs or participate in projects.
  	- Auditors should refrain from using any course and TF resources that are designed for our registered students like Ed, FASOnDemand, JupyterHub, and office hours.
	- Auditors must have an active HUID number.
  - If you agree to the above, send an email to cs109a2022@gmail.com with your HUID and state that you've read the auditing policy and that you agree to abide by these rules.

# Quizzes & Exercises
- **When are quizzes and exercises due?**
    - All 'pre-class reading check' quizzes and exercises presented in class are ungraded and so have no due date, though solutions will be released within a few days.
    - All graded quizzes and exercises on Ed will be 'bundled' with a given HW assignment and so will share that HW's due date. Each HW assignment will make clear which Ed quizzes and exercises are to be completed as part of the assignment.
